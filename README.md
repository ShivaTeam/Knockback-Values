# Knockback-Values
This is a list filled with knockback values old servers used like Kohi, MineHQ, Badlion, etc. 
This was mainly created so people stop obsessing over knockback and creating random servers claiming they have x knockback. 

NOTE: You may need to edit your spigot for certain configurations to work.

Enjoy!
